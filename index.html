    <h1>Explain Var, Let and Const</h1>
    <ul>
        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">Var:</h3>
        <li>Var is a functional as well as Global Scope</li>
        <li>Var can be reinitialized and redeclared</li>
        <li>var can be modified later</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">Let:</h3>
        <li>Let is a Block Scope</li>
        <li>Let cannot be reinitialized and redeclared</li>
        <li>Let can be modified later</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">Const:</h3>
        <li>Const is a Block Scope</li>
        <li>Const cannot be reinitialized and redeclared</li>
        <li>Const cannot be modified later</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What is Hoisting?</h1>
    <p>Hoising is a phenemenon by which we can access vaiables and functions even before we initialize it.In case of var it is undefined but in case of let and const it throws a Reference Error.</p>

    <h1>What is Temporal Dead Zone?</h1>
    <p>It is the time between the hoisting and the initialization of variables. Even let and const are hoisted but they are in different space called Temporal Dead Zone.</p>
